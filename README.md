# Introduction

This repository is meant to collect common knowledge related to the [Gerrit Code
Review tool](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/), as well as the ecosystem of
software (core, plugins and tooling), and practices that accompany it.

This wiki is not intended to supersede any specific documentation, nor to
replace the [repo-discuss](https://groups.google.com/g/repo-discuss) mailing
list (which is still the main source of information and help regarding Gerrit).

Nevertheless, this wiki aims to point to that information to make it
easier to find, to consume, and, where possible, to integrate it with
gotchas, explanations and experiences that might go beyond the realm of Gerrit
alone.
